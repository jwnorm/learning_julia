## **Exercise 1:** _Calculating frequencies_

In this exercise we practise using dictionaries in Julia by writing our own version of the `countmap` function. Recall that that function counts the number of times that a given (discrete) value occurs in an input data set.

A suitable data structure for this is a **dictionary**, since it allows us to store data that is very sparse (i.e. for which many input values do not occur).

#### Exercise 1.2
The dictionary contains the information as a sequence of **pairs** mapping keys to values. This is not a particularly useful form for us. Instead, we would prefer a vector of the keys and a vector of the values, sorted in order of the key.

We are going to make a new version `counts2` where you do the following (below). Start off by just running the following commands each in their own cell on the dictionary `test_counts` you got by running the previous `counts` function on the vector `test_data` so that you see the result of running each command. Once you have understood what's happening at *each* step, add them to the `counts2` function in a new cell.

👉 Extract vectors `ks` of keys and `vs` of values using the `keys()` and `values()` functions and convert the results into a vector using the `collect` function.

## Intermezzo: _**function**_ vs. _**begin**_ vs. _**let**_
$(html"<span id=function_begin_let></span>")

In our lecture materials, we sometimes use a `let` block in this cell to group multiple expressions together, but how is it different from `begin` or `function`?

> ##### function
> Writing functions is a way to group multiple expressions (i.e. lines of code) together into a mini-program. Note the following about functions:
> - A function always returns **one object**.[^1] This object can be given explicitly by writing `return x`, or implicitly: Julia functions always return the result of the last expression by default. So `f(x) = x+2` is the same as `f(x) = return x+2`.
> - Variables defined inside a function are _not accessible outside the function_. We say that function bodies have a **local scope**. This helps to keep your program easy to read and write: if you define a local variable, then you don't need to worry about it in the rest of the notebook.
> 
> There are two other ways to group expressions together that you might have seen before: `begin` and `let`.

> ##### begin
> **`begin`** will group expressions together, and it takes the value of its last subexpression. 
>     
> We use it in this notebook when we want multiple expressions to always run together.

> ##### let
> **`let`** also groups multiple expressions together into one, but variables defined inside of it are **local**: they don't affect code outside of the block. So like `begin`, it is just a block of code, but like `function`, it has a local variable scope.
> 
> We use it when we want to define some local (temporary) variables to produce a complicated result, without interfering with other cells. Pluto allows only one definition per _global_ variable of the same name, but you can define _local_ variables with the same names whenever you wish!

[^1]: Even a function like 
    
    `f(x) = return`
    
    returns **one object**: the object `nothing` — try it out!

## **Exercise 2:** _Modelling component failure with the geometric distribution_

In this exercise, we will investigate the simple model of failure of mechanical components (or light bulbs, or radioactive decay, or recovery from an infection, or...) that we saw in lectures. 
Let's call $\tau$ the time to failure.

We will use a  simple model, in which each component has probability $p$ to fail each day. If it fails on day $n$, then $\tau = n$.
We see that $\tau$ is a random variable, so we need to study its **probability distribution**.

> ### Note about plotting
> 
> Plots.jl has an interesting property: a plot is an object, not an action. Functions like `plot`, `bar`, `histogram` don't draw anything on your screen - they just return a `Plots.Plot`. This is a struct that contains the _description_ of a plot (what data should be plotted in what way?), not the _picture_.
> 
> So a Pluto cell with a single line, `plot(1:10)`, will show a plot, because the _result_ of the function `plot` is a `Plot` object, and Pluto just shows the result of a cell.
>
> ##### Modifying plots
> Nice plots are often formed by overlaying multiple plots. In Plots.jl, this is done using the **modifying functions**: `plot!`, `bar!`, `vline!`, etc. These take an extra (first) argument: a previous plot to modify.
> 
> For example, to plot the `sin`, `cos` and `tan` functions in the same view, we do:
> ```julia
> function sin_cos_plot()
>     T = -1.0:0.01:1.0
>     
>     result = plot(T, sin.(T))
>     plot!(result, T, cos.(T))
>     plot!(result, T, tan.(T))
>
>     return result
> end
> ```
> 
> 💡 This example demonstrates a useful pattern to combine plots:
> 1. Create a **new** plot and store it in a variable
> 2. **Modify** that plot to add more elements
> 3. Return the plot
> 
> ##### Grouping expressions
> It is highly recommended that these 3 steps happen **within a single cell**. This can prevent some strange glitches when re-running cells. There are three ways to group expressions together into a single cell: `begin`, `let` and `function`. More on this [here](#function_begin_let)!

## **Exercise 4:** _Distribution of the "atmosphere"_

In this question we will implement a (very!) simple model of the density of the atmosphere, using a **random walk**, i.e. a particle that undergoes random *motion*. (We will see more about random walks in lectures.)

We can think of a very light dust particle being moved around by the wind. We are only interested in its vertical position, $y$, and we will suppose for simplicity that $y$ is an integer. The particle jumps up and down randomly as it is moved by the wind; however, due to gravity it has a higher probability $p$ of moving downwards (to $y-1$) than upwards (to $y+1$), which happens with probability $1-p$.

At $y = 1$ there is a **boundary condition**: it hits a reflective boundary (the "surface of the Earth"). We can model this using "bounce-back": if the particle tries to jump downwards from $y=1$ then it hits a reflective boundary and bounces back to $y=1$. (In other words it remains in the same place.)
